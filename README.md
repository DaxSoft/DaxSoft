Creating my own truth and setting my own path towards my own self. 

“In many ways, unwise love is the truest love. Anyone can love a thing because. That’s as easy as putting a penny in your pocket. But to love something despite. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect.” — THE WISE MAN’S FEAR, Patrick Rothfuss
