Creating my own truth and setting my own path towards my own self. 

‚ÄúIn many ways, unwise love is the truest love. Anyone can love a thing because. That‚Äôs as easy as putting a penny in your pocket. But to love something despite. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect.‚Äù ‚Äî THE WISE MAN‚ÄôS FEAR, Patrick Rothfuss
